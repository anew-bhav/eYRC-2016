This repository contitutes of the code develpoed during eYantra Robotics Competition 2016.  

The project was developed during the eYRC ( eYantra Robotics Competition ), 2016. The competition aimed to develop a robotic system to do a task based on a theme. The theme assigned to our team was Cross-A-Crater. This theme had an arena with several obstacles, which made the robot traversal difficult. The robot had to remove the obstacles and then traverse the arena to reach the destination choosing an appropriate path.

I worked primarily on the image processing module of the application which worked as an eye for the robot.
Moreover, I also worked on the grabbing mechanism of the robot which facilitated it to pick up the boulders and fill the obstacles.
